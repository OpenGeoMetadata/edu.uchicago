    "This file corrects several problems in the original TIGER/line files, notably the inclusion of parts of Lake Michigan within the city limits, and the numerous irregularities that are a function of the way the TIGER/line files were created. This file will consequently not line up with TIGER/line streets or tracts; itwillline up with the 1992 ward boundary file. Its author is Christopher Siciliano."
