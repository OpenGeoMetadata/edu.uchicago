    "This map was current from 1992 until 1998, when litigation forced some boundary changes. This file contains accurate straight lines in some places where the corresponding street files have inaccurate crooked lines. The author of this boundary file is Christopher Siciliano. It was edited very slightly in 2001 by George Stachokas."
